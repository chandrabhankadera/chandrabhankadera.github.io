            <h3>A guava forest in Bundelkhand</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              This journey started 80 years ago from now, When we came from Kaushambi district and settled our house on the barren lands here. And in the beginning, we planted 2 hectare of guava trees and after that 1 hectare of mango trees were planted then the process started.
            </p>
			<p class="fst-italic"> We have planted trees like Lemon, Jackfruit, Mango, Amla, Jamun, Guava, Sharifa and Cherry etc.</p>
			
            <p>Our house, or rather it is in the middle of our guava orchards and there is no house anywhere from two to three kilometers around, there are two water well in the garden and there is a big pond. Small rivers come from two sides and join each other. Due to which it has become even more beautiful.</p>
			
			<p>Our house is still made of old style, which brings back the old memories of the village, but still we use all the model services of the city, there is a 5 kW solar panel for electricity. Apart from this, we are also connected to the power grid.</p>
			
			<p>There is a <del>well</del> and submersible  for drinking water.</p>
			
			<p>We use water from ponds, wells and rivers to irrigate our gardens. In such a situation, nutritious and delicious fruits are available every year. We do not use chemical fertilizers on trees and vegetables so that we get organic fruits and vegetables.</p>
			
			<p><strong>If you are troubled by the bustling life of the city then take out time to come to us and learn the simple way of living life.</strong></p>
